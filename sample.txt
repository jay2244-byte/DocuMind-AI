
The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. 
The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.
